There is an Algebra class every Saturday from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM each week. The aim of this class is to improve understanding of various advanced topics, most of which were not studied thoroughly during my undergraduate studies. Most of the topics are listed and arranged based on the [Stanford PhD qualifying exam][Stanford-syllabus] Algebra syllabus, with an additional chapter on Category Theory. 

There are a lot of things to cover, so I am not sure when we will finish all the syllabus though.
