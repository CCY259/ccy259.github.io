The exam is coming up, so I made a quiz for my students. But for some reasons it was not shared properly so only few students (and my friends) have did it.

The content is based on SIM2002 Linear Algebra Syllabus.

Check out the [quiz here][quiz].

After a few of them did it, I actually enjoyed reading their answers. They were just too funny!
