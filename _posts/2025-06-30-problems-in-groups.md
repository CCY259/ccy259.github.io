Here are some group theory practice questions I compiled for the [Algebra class](https://ccy259.github.io/algebra/2025/06/27/algebra.html) held in March. The problems are not ordered by difficulty and are primarily for my own training, not for others.

I didn't write complete solutions since everything was just a scramble during our discussions!
