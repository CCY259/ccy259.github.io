*This post is created to test the feature of inserting images into a post.*

I had a PS2 when I was small, and I fell in love with games since then. Now the games look incredibly beautiful and realistic. Thatâ€™s when I started getting into virtual photography. instead of just focusing on beating enemies and bosses. The shots are so satisfying!

All shots were captured on Playstation 5. I would love to get a camera and latest game console if I have enough money.
