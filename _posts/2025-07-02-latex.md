## How to Add LaTeX to the Website
I follow the steps in [this post](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/How-to-add-mathjax-to-minimal-mistakes/). It works for me so I won't bother about why it works.

## Examples
Let us write down some theorems to test the feature.

**Theorem.** (Brunn-Minkowski Inequality)
Let $\mathcal{K}^n$ be the set of all convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$. For any $A,B\in\mathcal{K}^n$ and for $\alpha\in[0,1]$,

$$
    \begin{align*}
		V_n\left((1-\alpha)A+\alpha B\right)^{1/n} \geq (1-\alpha)V_n(A)^{1/n}+\alpha V_n(B)^{1/n}.
    \end{align*}
$$

Equality holds for some $\alpha \in (0,1)$ iff $A$ and $B$ either lie in parallel hyperplanes or are homothetic.

**Theorem.** (Erd≈ës-Selfridge Theorem) Let $\mathcal{F}$ be an $n$-uniform hypergraph, and assume that $$\lvert\mathcal{F}\rvert+\operatorname{Max}\operatorname{Deg}\mathcal{F} < 2^n$$, where $\operatorname{Max}\operatorname{Deg}\mathcal{F}$ denotes the maximum degree of hypergraph $\mathcal{F}$. Then playing the Maker-Breaker game on $\mathcal{F}$, Breaker (the second player) can put his mark in every $A \in \mathcal{F}$.

**Theorem.** (Invariant Factor Decomposition) A finitely generated module $M$ over a principal ideal domain $R$ is the direct sum of a free submodule $E$ of finite rank and a finite number of cyclic torsion modules. The cyclic torsion summands (if any) are of orders $q_1,\dots, q_r$ where $q_1,\dots, q_r$ are (not necessarily distinct) nonzero nonunit elements such that $q_1\lvert q_2\lvert \cdots \lvert q_r$. The rank of $F$ and the ideals $(q_1),\dots, (q_r)$ are uniquely determined by $M$. In particular,

$$
	\begin{align*}
		M&= Rx_1\oplus \cdots \oplus Rx_r\oplus F\\
		&\cong R/(q_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus R/(q_r)\oplus M/M_t
	\end{align*}
$$

where $x_1,\dots, x_r\in M$ with $\mathcal{O}_{x_i} = (q_i)$ for all $i=1,\dots, r$.
