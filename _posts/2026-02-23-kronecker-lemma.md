<!-- We need to put space before $$ and after $$ to make sure the equation is on the center. -->

## Statement
Let $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ be real sequences such that $(a_n)$ diverges to $\infty$ and the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_n}{a_n}$ converges. Then 
$$
\frac{1}{a_n} \sum_{m=1}^n b_m \to 0
$$
as $n\to \infty$.

**Proof.**
